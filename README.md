A Python-based AI chatbot that is implemented with Flask REST API.

Library requirements:
-Flask
-TensorFlow

Various files that are required:
-style.css
-css.css
-index.html
-train.py
-app.py


Run the "training.py" script to start the model's training process. The result of this is a file called "chatbot_modell.h5," which functions as a model so that the Flask REST API can respond to requests without requiring retraining. Start and initialize the bankbot by launching "mainappl.py" after "training.py" has been executed. You can improve the bot's understanding by making changes to the "intentsfile.json" file, adding new patterns and phrases, and then retraining the model.
